# Covering my ass
I've found the private SF Symbols useful when looking for a symbol to see if a symbol for something **does** exist but has been roped off or if a symbol doesn't exist at all. Mostly for myself, private SF Symbols have been appended to the end of the list. They start at "clipboard" and end at "emoji.dog.face.inverse". Do not use them in production. I'm not sure if the UWB symbol is private, it's a hidden Unicode character and not an actual symbol.
